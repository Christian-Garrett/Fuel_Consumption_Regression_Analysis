## Hi my name's Christian <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I'm passionate about my work as a Data Scientist because I'm a systems thinker who loves answering questions that begin with 'why'.

### Background

The United States is both the largest producer an consumer of oil. As a result, this research would be relevant to any private or public interests concerned with the relationship between oil consumption and any envirnomental repercussions.

### Data

The data set was generated between the years of 1984 and 2017 and furnished by the US Environmental Protection Agency. It is composed of 81 features and over 38,000 observations from 133 vehicles. 

### Features

I implemented an OLS regression routine that executes recursively until all of the remaining linear or polynomial features are significant. The implementation also keeps track of the feature inter-relarionships for any degree polynomial curve fit. Feature selection has been automated for all continuous, discrete and categorical variables based on various user defined threshold settings. The results of the lineaer and polynomial regression were compared with three non parametric regression  models: k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Decision Trees and a Support Vector Machine. 

### Technologies

The code is written in Python 3.0 and incorporates various popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, SciPy and StatsModels and MatPlotlib.

### Results

Based on a combination of explanatory power, predictive power and result speed I would choose the KNN Regression algorithm to model this particular data set under the current conditions. This model achieved a K-Fold cross validation mean accuracy score of 99.6% on the test validation set.

### Future Goals

One area for improvement would be to increase the hardware capability of the machine running this model. This would allow for more extensive hyperparameter tuning and testing of higher order polynomial regression. In addition, if I had more time to increase my domain knowledge I may have identified opportunities to combine features to improve model accuracy.
